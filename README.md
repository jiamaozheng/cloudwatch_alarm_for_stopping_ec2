## Notes
There are three scenarios for stopped instanceâ€™s CloudWatch alarm.

1) `No Data` alarm status. If you restart your instance, CloudWatch will work as expected.

2) `ALARM` alarm status #1. If you restart your instance AND do some work, CloudWatch will work as expected. You will notice that ALARM alarm status will disappear and OK will appear in a few minutes.

3) `ALARM` alarm status #2. If you restart your instance AND don't do any work, CloudWatch will NOT work as expected. The instance will not automatically stop because the instance alarm status is still ALARM, and CloudWatch alarm won't be triggered without any alarm status changes.

Please avoid last scenario. To solve this, please either do some work (like scenario 2) or stop your instance and wait for at least 1 hour.
